I built a simple chatbot for my friend's bachelor party, using Google Spreadsheets and OpenAI's GPT-3.5. 
We're heading to Zakopane, Poland, so I designed the chatbot to answer any questions related to the trip for all the participants. 
To make it even more fun, I had it respond in "g√≥ralska gwara" (the local dialect of the Polish highlanders), adding an authentic touch to the experience.
