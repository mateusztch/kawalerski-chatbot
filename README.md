## Virtual Assistant for Bachelor Party ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¤–

### Project Overview

While organizing a bachelor party for a friend, I saw a fun and unique opportunity to build a **virtual assistant** in the form of a **chatbot** to help the participants stay informed and organized throughout the trip.

Ofc to ensure privacy, all personal information such as names has been replaced with fictional data, so you're seeing a fully anonymized version of the assistant!

### Key Features
- **Google Sheets Integration**: I used Google Sheets as a dynamic database, where I stored and updated important trip details like the schedule, packing list, costs, and even weather forecasts. This setup allowed for **easy, real-time updates** to keep everyone on the same page! (btw the plan was changed a few times, so I had to do quick iterations)
  
- **LangChain & GPT-3.5 Turbo**: The core of the chatbot is powered by LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, offering a seamless conversational experience to handle a variety of queries from trip participants. I was working on iterations, trying to find the best temperature and build a clean prompt.

- **Streamlit Interface**: The chatbot's front-end is simply built using Streamlit, which provided interactive user interface for all the trip-related information.

### Technologies Used
- **LangChain** for building the AI-driven conversation flow
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo** for natural language understanding and generation
- **Streamlit** for an intuitive and interactive chatbot UI
- **Google Sheets** as a real-time, cloud-based database

This project was not only a fun way to assist in the bachelor party planning, but also a great experiment in combining **AI** and **real-time data** for practical uses. ðŸš€
